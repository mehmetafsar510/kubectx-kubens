----------------------------------
Kubernetes commands can be quite lengthy, so setting up some aliases for running kubectl is very helpful. You will no longer need to spell out the full command over and over again, making your life a lot easier when you want to execute multiple Kubernetes commands in one session.

We have listed aliases for some frequently used commands below. Run these before executing kubectl commands to save yourself some time.

git clone https://github.com/mehmetafsar510/kubectx-kubens.git

cd kubectx-kubens

cat kubectl-reduction.txt >> /root/.bashrc

bash
